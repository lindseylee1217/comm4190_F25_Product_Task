We brainstormed a product that is a 3D printer that prints food. With this basic concept, we went ahead and independently came up with two distinct products--HarmonyBites and Bytes.

This repository contains the following:
- two notebooks for the stage 1 independent brainstorming for our product
    - *Stage 1 - KH_Individual Product Idea Development.ipynb*
    - *Stage 1 - LL_Product Creation.ipynb*
- two notebooks for stage 2, where we did some further brainstorming with our selected A & B products (HarmonyBites & Bytes) and developed our webpage (markdown file)
    - *Stage 2 - Bytes & Webpage.ipynb*
    - *Stage 2_HarmonyBitesWebpage.ipynb*
