Lindsey Lee & Kaitlyn Hu

We brainstormed a product that is a 3D printer that prints food. With this basic concept, we went ahead and independently came up with two distinct products--HarmonyBites and Bytes.

This repository contains the following:
- two notebooks for the stage 1 independent brainstorming for our product
- two notebooks for stage 2, where we did some further brainstorming with our selected A & B products (HarmonyBites & Bytes) and developed our webpage (markdown file)
- two markdown files containing the webpage generation for products A & B (HarmonyBites & Bytes)
- one stage 3 notebook containing our A-B testing.
